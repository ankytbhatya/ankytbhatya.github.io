# Job Market Paper
**Protected Land Rights, Misallocation, and Dead Capital**

*Protected Land Rights (PLRs) for marginalized communities encompass a quarter of land resources across 90 countries.
Yet, the impact of PLRs on structural transformation and economic development is poorly understood. Theoretically,
protection could support local entrepreneurship and industry. On the other hand, such measures might lead to the economic
isolation of targeted areas. Drawing on newly collected historical and high-resolution data in the context of a spatial
regression discontinuity design, this paper studies the long-run impact of PLRs. Land transfer restrictions between targeted
and out-group members led to 17% higher agricultural income share, 15% lower firm density in non-primary sectors, and 8%
lesser housing capital in PLR areas relative to adjacent non-PLR areas. Higher transaction costs in land markets led to
land misallocation and impeded efficient land use conversion and agglomeration economies. Reducing constraints on
market transactions for marginalized groups may thus foster entrepreneurship and growth*

**Bridges, Market Access, and City Growth**

*This study uses a two-way fixed-effects model to explore how bridge connectivity influences city growth and the spatial distribution of economic activity across 8,000 city clusters in India. By constructing a counterfactual market access measure that removes bridge connections from the transportation network, I isolate the marginal impact of bridges. Preliminary analysis with a newly geocoded dataset of 1,172 large bridges suggests that bridge connectivity contributed to approximately 12% of built-up area growth in the post-liberalization period.*
