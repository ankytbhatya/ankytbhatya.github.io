# Protect Land Rights, Misallocation, and Dead Capital: Evidence from India (Job Market Paper)
*Using a geographic Regression Discontinuity Design, this study examines the long-term impact of
protected land rights on the structural transformation of Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs). By
analyzing a law that restricts land transfers between targeted and out-groups within IPAs, I explore
how land restrictions undermine agglomeration and perpetuate poverty. Geocoding IPA boundaries
from colonial archives and combining them with high-resolution raster data on built-up areas, I argue
that legal discontinuities in property rights contributed to lower land conversion, effectively
misallocating land to low-productivity uses. Furthermore, restrictions on land leasing and mortgaging
led to land asset undervaluation, adversely impacting the welfare of targeted communities.*

# Bridges, Market Access, and City Growth
*Using a two-way fixed-effects model on market access, this study explores how bridge connectivity influences city growth and the spatial distribution of firms across 8,000 city clusters in India. By constructing a counterfactual market access measure that removes bridge connections from the transportation network (following Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2016), I isolate the marginal impact of bridges. Preliminary analysis with a newly geocoded dataset of 1,172 large bridges reveals that bridge connectivity contributed to approximately 12% of built-up area growth in the post-liberalization period. Additionally, there is evidence of spatial sorting of manufacturing firms away from bridge sites, aligning with urban agglomeration models. The effects are most pronounced in cities with active urban land development authorities, indicating their crucial cordinnation and market clearing role.*
