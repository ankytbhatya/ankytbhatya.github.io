I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in International Development & Economics at the Johns Hopkins University. My broad research is at the intersection of development economics, economic geography, and infrastructure governance with a strong focus on quantitative methods. In my current 
research, I focus on land markets frictions and their impact on urbanization, and infrastructre growth in developing economies. A key feature of my research is its emphasis on building large micro datasets from developing countries to answer macro development questions. To that end, I use a combination of spatial micro econometrics, causal machine learing, and natural language processing in my work. 

I hold master's and bachelorâ€™s degrees in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. Before my Phd, I have been affiliated with policy research institutions including the Centre for Policy Research (CPR); Carnegie Endowment for International Peace India; Brookings Institution India Centre (now CSEP); University of Chicago Delhi Centre; National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP); and Planning Commission, Government of India (now NITI Aayog). 

Beyond my academic and professional interests, I enjoy cooking, cricketing, and seriously humoring my family and friends.
