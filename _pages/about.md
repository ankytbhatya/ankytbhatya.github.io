I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), specializing in international economics and development with a particular focus on South Asia. My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics, public infrastructure, and state capacity. My current research combines geospatial and quantitative data analysis methods including machine learning, natural language processing, and remote sensing technology to study the political economy dynamics of land markets on urbanization, infrastructure development, and clean energy transitions in emerging markets.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I hold master's and bachelorâ€™s degrees in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur and have rich experience in policy research & analysis working with esteemed scholars at prestigious institutions in India including the Centre for Policy Research (CPR); Carnegie Endowment for International Peace India; Brookings Institution India Centre (now CSEP); University of Chicago Delhi Centre; National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP); Planning Commission, Government of India (now NITI Aayog); and Delhi School of Economics. 

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy cooking, cricketing, and seriously humoring my family and friends.
