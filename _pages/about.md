I'm a PhD. candidate in International Development & Economics at the Johns Hopkins University. My broad research is at the intersection of development economics, economic geography, and institutions with a strong focus on spatial quantitative methods. In my current 
research, I focus on how land market frictions impact urbanization, economic activity, and infrastructure growth in emerging markets. A key feature of my research is its emphasis on building large micro datasets to answer macro development questions. To that end, I use a combination of high resolution geospatial analytics, causal machine learning, and natural language processing in my work. 

I hold master's and bachelorâ€™s degrees in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. Before my PhD., I have been affiliated with policy research institutions including the Centre for Policy Research; Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Brookings Institution; University of Chicago Delhi Centre; National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; and Planning Commission, Government of India (now NITI Aayog). 

Beyond my academic and professional interests, I enjoy cooking, cricketing, and seriously humoring my family and friends.
